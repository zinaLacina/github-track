The easiest way to install is to use  [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/GhTrack/),

Short tutorial
---------------------
Let's test the base features of the module, that consist to pull the last
7 days pull requests of a public repo.
By default the module has default value in the settings located in the data folder.
The default repo is ``kubernetes``.
So to get the list of the last 7 days pull requests of the ``kubernetes`` repo.

Open a terminal, and in the console please type >>``python3``
After that, import the ``GhTrack`` module
.. code-block:: python
 >> from GhTrack import GhTrack
 # create GhTrack object without any params(first of all the default params)
 >> g = GhTrack()
 #That will print on the console the html of the last 7 days pull requests
 >> g.sendEmailOrPrintConsole(emailNotConsole=False)

You can also get the json format of the last 7 days pull requests
.. code-block:: python
   >>  from GhTrack import GhTrack
   >> g = GhTrack()
   >> pulls = g.getPulls()
   #json format
   >> pulls
Then play with your Github objects::

    for pull in pulls:
        print(pull["title"])
