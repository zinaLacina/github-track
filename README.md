Short tutorial
--------------

Let's test the base features of the module, that consist to pull the last 7 days pull requests of a public repo. By default the module has default value in the settings located in the data folder. The default repo is `kubernetes`. So to get the list of the last 7 days pull requests of the `kubernetes` repo.

Open a terminal, and in the console please type.
`>> python3` 
After that, import the `GhTrack` module 
```bash
>> from GhTrack import GhTrack
# create GhTrack object without any params(first of all the default params)
>> g = GhTrack() 
#Print on the console the html of the last 7 days pull requests 
>> g.sendEmailOrPrintConsole(emailNotConsole=False)
```

You can also get the json format of the last 7 days pull requests 
```bash
>> from GhTrack import GhTrack 
>> g = GhTrack() 
>> pulls = g.getPulls()
#Print the json format 
>> pulls
```
Then play with your GhTrack objects:
```bash
>> for pull in pulls:
>> ...print(pull["title"])
```
